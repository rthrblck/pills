## About

This is a project by Art and Alan.

Inspired by Arthur's 10000 pills, and general dislike of other trackers currently on the market.

### How much does it cost?

Nothing.

#### Wait, How do you make money?

We don't.

#### So you are going to run advertisements?

Umm... probably not.  At least not unless running the service becomes expensive.

### Tools it's Built With

- [design](./design) = `Sketch` _(art)_
- [app](./app) = `react-native` _(art & alan)_
- backend = `elixir` _(alan)_
